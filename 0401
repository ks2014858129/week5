vi Commands
vi commands are used in "screen" mode (the default), where
you use the commands to move around tne screen and to per-
form operations on the text.
Most vi commands follow a general pattern:
	[command][number]textobject
or the equivalent form:
	[number][command]textobject
Movement Commands
vi movement commands distinguish between two kinds of
"words." The lowercase eommands define a word as a contig=
uous sequence of undercores, letters, and digits. The upper-
case commands define a word as a contiguous sequence of
nonwhitespace characters.
